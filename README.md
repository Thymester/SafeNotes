## Features

1. **Automatic Version Control**: SafeNotes automatically checks for updates with every launch. It will then prompt you to update if you are out of date with every launch, and I understand that can be unpleasant, but our goal is for people to update to the newest versions, so that was intended.
2. **Encryption and Hashing:** SafeNotes will encrypt entries on closure and decrypt entries when the user logs into SafeNotes. All of this secured behind password authentication which is protected via hashing so nothing is ever stored in plain text.
3. **Password Verification**: Users must log in with a password to access their notes, ensuring privacy and security.
4. **Password Generator**: Easily create strong and unique passwords with the built-in password generator.
