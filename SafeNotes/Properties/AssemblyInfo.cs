// Major Version: Incremented when Minor and Bugs reset to 0.
// Minor Version: Incremented when new features are added more than just bug fixes.
// Bugs Version: Incremented when bug fixes are made.
// Build Number: Incremented when a new build is made, usually for internal use. 0 is first build, 1 is second build, etc.
// NOTE: Assembly version is incremented with the AssemblyFileVersion. Also, Bug fixes can increment the Bugs version more than once per release.
// Minor releases will only increment once per release; however, Bug fixes can be made internally and increment the value without releasing a new version.
// Bug fixes are the most common and can be made multiple times per release.
// Minor releases are SafeNotes "Major" releases, Major releases will ONLY increment when Minor releases are at 9 when a new Minor release is made.

// In other words; Minor releases are the Major releases of SafeNotes, and the Major release will only increment when Minor releases are at 9 - instead of resetting to zero
// it resets to zero and then increments the Major release. Bug releases are the typical release but can increment Minor releases if they are at 9 and the build is also at 9.
